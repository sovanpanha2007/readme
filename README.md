## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sovanpanha Vong!

I'm a **software engineering student** at CADT in Cambodia, driven by curiosity and a love for coding. I may be just a random person on the internet, but I find joy in building things for fun and pushing the boundaries of what I can learn.

### 💻 What I Do
- Coding for fun and curiosity—always tinkering and trying new things!
- Took initiative and coded a majority of core functions for my school project (in **C**).
- Exploring all things tech, from software engineering fundamentals to new trends in the field.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Software engineering concepts and practices
- New languages and frameworks
- Creative projects (especially those that challenge me)

### 🏀🏈 Hobbies
- Playing basketball and football
- Exploring the world of technology
